// Exercise 3.6
// The average-grade computation in ยง3.1/36 might divide by zero if the student didn't enter any grades.
// Division by zero is undefined in C++, which means that the implementation is permitted to do anything it likes.
// What does your C++ implementation do in this case? Rewrite the program so that its behavior does not depend on
// how the implementation treats division by zero.
